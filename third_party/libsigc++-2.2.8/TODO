Compatibility:

- Fix compilation for SUN FORTE C++ 5.5.


Configure checks and Makefile issues:

- When you use a single Makefile.am for
  several directories (in sigc++2, all under sigc++/ is ruled by a
  single Makefile.am with the new build system), you have a problem when
  you do a build where $(srcdir) != $(builddir), since in the build-tree
  the necessary subdirectories are not created. So I have to find a
  place where to create this directories, in case they do not exist. 
  This is only an issue for clean CVS checkouts, however (Andy)


sigc++-1.2 compatibility:

- Verify completeness.


documentation:

- Improve documentation: Make groups (see index.html). Exclude stuff to make
  the html output readable.

- Add documentation for adaptors and accumulators.


basic functionality:

- I don't understand what is meant by "stl-pointer-like functions" (Martin):

  slot should have the full set of stl pointer like functions. (Karl Nelson)


lambda functionality (I don't understand this (Martin)):

- Add support for _R to force references down into 
  the stack frame of lambda.  Ie.

  A a;
  (_1+_2)(1,a);  // fail if no "operator int() const"

- Call groups in lambda.  (Huh, that appears to be in group?)


Old TODO's that should be almost finished (Martin):

- Fine-tooth comb the code looking for missing operator =() function
  and missing copy constructors.

- Improve and expand the test suite.  There are a lot of combinations which
  should be valid but haven't been tested which are likely to result in
  wierd compiler errors if something wasn't done consistantly.  


Old TODO's that should be finished (Martin):

- Improve signal#, it currently is just barely functional.
- Add iterator support and stl like functionality to signal.

- Add blocking capablity to slot.

- Deinline/move to .cc where possible to move functions into the
  library to reduce resulting binary size.
