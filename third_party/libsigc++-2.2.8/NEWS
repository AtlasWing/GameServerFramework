2.2.8:

Nothing interesting. Just a small change for library.gnome.org.

2.2.7:

* Documentation:
  - Added main page text with doxygen.
  (David King, Murray Cumming)
  - Fix the functors Doxygen group.
  (David King)

* Slight documentation changes.
  (Murray Cumming) Bug #614741 (Armin Burgmeier)

2.2.5:

* Accumulators: Allow return types that are different to the signal's.
  (Krzysztof Kosiński)

  (Michael Hasselmann)
* Fix the MSVC++ build.
  (Armin Burgmeier)

2.2.4.2 (stable):

* Namespace sigc is now documented, in order to make large chunks of the
  reference reappear.  (Daniel Elstner)
* The shipped reference documentation has been regenerated using Doxygen
  1.6.1, so that the document type is now XHTML 1.0.  (Daniel Elstner)
* The shipped Devhelp file has been generated with a newer version of the
  XSLT script in mm-common, so that documentation groups no longer appear
  as namespace prefixes in the keyword list.  (Daniel Elstner)

2.2.4.1 (stable):

* Reenable the per-class hierarchy graphs in the reference documentation.
  (Daniel Elstner)
* Drop the custom HTML header and footer, and use the shared doxygen.css
  file from mm-common. (Daniel Elstner)

* New build system based on mm-common. The mm-common module is now
  required for building from the git repository, but not for builds
  of release archives. (Daniel Elstner)
* The public reference documentation is now hosted on library.gnome.org.
  (Frédéric Péters, Daniel Elstner)

build for some reason (Please report such bugs).

* Removed the SigC:: namespace and other compatibility API,
  to fix the build with some versions of some compilers,
  such as the SUN Forte C++ CC compiler.
  See bug #302098, for instance
  (Murray Cumming)
* sigc::signal<>:
  - Added Added typedefs for
  value_type, reference, and pointer, so that these
  iterators are more like standard C++ iterators, so they can
  be used with standard C++ algorithms.
  (Michael Elkstrand) (Bug #417926).
  - Added emit_reverse().
  (John Profic)

  destruction of the member variables, to avoid a leak.
  (Andreas Ames, bug #306249)
* Allow recursive signal emission again.
  (Neal E. Coombes, bug #303896)
* SUN Forte CC 5.5 build fixes:
  - test_compatibility minor fix.
  - visit_each() template specializations:
  Mention the bool I_derives_trackable template type,
  (Friedemann Kleint, bug #305647)
 - Check for the non-standard SUN reverse_iterator,
  and use alternative code if necessary.
  (Murray Cumming)

2.0.12:

* Fixes crashes when using virtual inheritance, particularly
  with bound by-reference parameters, caused by casting
  from derived to base when the derived destructor has run.
  (Régis Duchesne)
  This might affect non-g++ compilers, so do tell us about
  any problems.

  of a slot from all referred trackables during signal emission.

  to support explicit parameter conversion.

([functor], [lambdas])".
* Made many fixes to lambda functionality.
* Added var() and constant() lambda creators.

references in bind and group adaptors.
* Expanded test suite.
* Added documentation. (Corrections by Murray Cumming)

1.9.6:

* First public release of the unstable 2.0 generation.
  libsigc++ 2.0 uses modern C++ mechanisms to achieve a highly
  flexible, yet typesafe callback system. It supports all features of
  libsigc++ 1.2 and improves upon it by:
  - No need to specify the number of arguments in signal definitions.
  - Connection of any compatible (=implicitly convertable) functor
   to a signal.
  - Implicit type conversions of parameters during signal emission.
  - Lambda adaptor for complete restructuring of functor parameter
   lists in one line (subject to changes).
  - Signal has a fully featured stl style list interface.
  - A convinient accumulator API (replacing the old marshaller API).
  - Removal of unnecessary memory management functionality.
  - Lightweight class "trackable" for use as base class of your
   class hierarchy replaces class "Object".
